  <p>How did you end up here? Through my shameless self-promotion probably. Let me welcome you: I'm a very curious security analyst and this is where I experiment. I do mostly CTFs and pentesting, but I'm a learning addict so Reverse Engineering, Python programming, network security, etc, they interest me all!</p>

  <p>The blog posts I write will help me to explain what I discover, what I learn, and hopefully it will make me better at what I do. Who knows? It might even help someone some day.</p>

  <p>Please do not use any of these articles I write as expert sources, nor am I responsible for the way the tools presented here can be used online. The real experts might even get angry sometimes at my mistakes but that's ok. Let's begin /../../../../</p>
